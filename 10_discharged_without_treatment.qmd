For **Artois-Picardie, Rhin-Meuse, Seine-Normandie and Loire-Bretagne basins**, we have some estimations made in their experts assessments *Etat des lieux* reports.

For **Artois-Picardie and Rhin-Meuse**, some data was also provided about direct discharge flows, for the largest wastewater treatment plants. However this only concerns water volumes and not pollutant flows As discharges tend to have lower concentrations (because of dilution during storms), these should be seen as upper bounds.

For **Loire-Bretagne and Adour-Garonne**, we have data about direct discharge for the largest wastewater treatment plants, downloaded from the basins webpages (see in the tab *WWTP flows preparation*). Contrary to Artois Picardie and Rhin-Meuse, these relate to pollutant flows, and not water volumes. The analyses are made on Loire-Bretagne's and Adour-Garonne's respective *WWTP flows preparation* pages, and are not reproduced here. We only report the results from these pages.

**Rhône-Méditerranée** is the only basin for which we do not have any data related to direct discharges. For this basin we use the estimations made for Adour-Garonne, which is the other basin from Southern France.

In the following we mention French regumatory points (A1, A2, A3...) related to sewers networks and wastewater treatment plants. Their definition can be seen on this [page](https://www.lozere.gouv.fr/content/download/10812/69814/file/les%20points%20r%C3%A9glementaires%20de%20surveillance.pdf){target="_blank"}, or by clicking on the drop-down menu below. Note that these monitored points can underestimate the actual sewers discharge to the environment, as there are sewers leakage that are not monitored.

<details>

<summary>click to see French regulatory points (A1, A2...)</summary>

To summarize the regulatory points of the graph below:

  - A1 : discharge from the sewers (not necessarily one unique)
  - A2 : last discharge before the wastewater treatment plant (one unique)
  - A3 : flow entering the wastewater treatment plant
  - A4 : outgoing flow of the wastewater treatment plant, after treatment
  - A5 : by-pass, flow that entered the plant but which was not treated (rare)

In our analysis, we merge A1 and A2 point together and refer to them as "sewers direct discharge". A3 is considered the flow into the WWTP, A4 the flow out. The A5 point is more unclear. When it is explicitly reported, we count it as as sewer direct discharge, because is is released without a treatment. But in some water agencies data, it is merged with the A4 point as a general WWTP "outflow". In any case, the flows in A5 point are small, and this only slightly impacts the results.

# Sources and estimations for each basin

::: panel-tabset
## Artois-Picardie

From the data we were communicated by mail (first tab below), discharges in A1 and A2 points represent 15-20% of the flow (in volume) entering the WWTP. Concentrations of discharges during storms tend to be lower than for usual flows during dry weather, so this rate is overestimated in terms of nutrient flows; on the other hand, these monitored discharges do not account for sewers leakage, leading to underestimation.

In the *Etat des lieux* report (second tab below), direct discharges without WWTP treatment are generally between \~10-25% of pollution entering the sewers Contrary to the data communicated by mail, this rate considers the different concentrations and unmonitored leakage, even though the estimations remains still very rough.

We keep **20%** as a final order of magnitude value: nutrient flow discharged from sewers (A1 + A2 + unmonitored leaks), as a share of the flow entering the wastewater treatment plant (A3 point).

::: panel-tabset
### Water flows in A1 and A2 (communicated by mail)

In the graphs below we show water flows on A1 and A2 points communicated by mail. The data concerns  WWTPs representing more than 5 million population equivalent, out of 6.4 million for Artois-Picardie basin, so \~80% of the basin capacity.

Discharges in A1 + A2 points represent 15-20% of the flow (in volume) entering the WWTP (A3 point). This does not take into account the different concentrations of stormwater, nor the network leaks. Concentrations of discharges tend to be lower than for usual flows; on the other hand, the unmonitored leaks probably increase the rate. We keep **15-20%** as an order of magnitude for this source.

### Etat des lieux (public report)

In the 2019 and 2013 *Etat des lieux* reports, direct discharges are generally between around \~10-25% of pollution entering the sewers We keep **20%** as an order of magnitude. The experts assessment relies both on nutrient flow measures on A1 and A2 points, but also on the difference between expected discharge by people and what is actually measured at the entrance of WWTP. So the limitation previously mentioned on unmonitored leakage and concentration does not apply here, eventhough the estimation is very rough.

## Rhin - Meuse

Similarly to the Artois-Picardie basin (previous tab), we were communicated data on water flows in A1 and A2 points, and we have studied the *Etat des lieux experts assessment report*. Values are around 15-25%, we keep **20%** as an order of magnitude.

::: panel-tabset
From the data we have were communicated (screenshot), A1 + A2 direct discharge flows represent about \~15% of total incoming flow, so **\~18%** the flow finally entering the WWTP.

In the *Etat des lieux*, the storm water represent **\~24%** of the pollution entering in the WWTP.

We keep **20%** as an intermediate value.

### Water flows in A1 and A2 (communicated by mail)

These data show that A1 + A2 direct discharge flows represent \~15% of total incoming flow, so **\~18%** the flow finally entering the WWTP.

## Seine-Normandie

For Seine-Normandie *Etat des lieux*, there is genarally a discrepancy concerning estimated pollution from direct discharge depending on the type of pollution considered. All expressed as % of pollution entering the WWTP:

-   DBO5, DCO and MES are generally around 7-15%
-   P is around 20-25% in 2013 and 2004
-   N is around 1-4% in 2013 and 2004

We are interested in N and P, which are the more extreme values. We consider that the 1% is an implausible outlier. We chose an intermediate value corresponding to DBO5, DCO and MES: **10%**. That means that N direct discharge could be overestimated by a factor 2.5 and P underestimated by 2-2.5.

If we say that about half of the rainwater entering sewers is discharged without treatment, we can estimate the pollution discharged without treatment as % of the A3 point (entrance of station) by :

(109-38/2)/(760-38/2) = **12%** of incoming pollution in A3

100/63 = **175%** of outgoing pollution in A4

In general, direct discharge of pollution represent *10-15%* of pollution entering the station in A3 point coherent with our precedent estimation. To compute this, we first compute direct discharge as % of WWTP outflow (A4 point), then compute as % of entrance (A3 point) using WWTP removal efficiency. See computation below.

##### N

Pollution discharged without treatment represents

(1.4+12.3)/23.5 = **60%** of A4 point (up to (1.4+12.3+5)/23.5 = **71%** with rainwater pollution)

and

60% x (1-0.83) = **10%** of A3 point (up to with rainwater 71% x (1-0.83) = **12%** pollution)

Rain water represents 5 / 23.5/(1-0.83) = **3.5%** of pollution in A3 point (station entrance)

##### P

Pollution discharged without treatment represents

(0.2+1.5)/3 = **55%** of A4 point (up to (0.2+1.5+1.2)/3 = **100%** with rainwater pollution)

and

55% x (1-0.83) = **9%** of A3 point (up to 100% x (1-0.83) = **17%** with rainwater pollution)

Rain water represents1.2 / 3/(1-0.83) = **7%** of pollution in A3 point (station entrance)

##### DBO5

Pollution discharged without treatment represents

(5.5+49)/12.2 = **450%** of A4 point (up to (5.5+49+33)/12.2 = **700%** with rainwater pollution)

and

450% x (1-0.98) = **9%** of A3 point (up to 700% x (1-0.98) = **14%** with rainwater pollution)

Rain water represents 33 / 12.2/(1-0.98) = **6%** of pollution in A3 point (station entrance)

##### DCO

Pollution discharged without treatment represents

(123+13.5)/89 = **150%** of A4 point (up to (123+13.5+200)/89 = **380%** with rainwater pollution)

and

150% x (1-0.94) = **9%** of A3 point (up to 380% x (1-0.94) = **23%** with rainwater pollution)

Rain water represents 200 / 89/(1-0.94) = **13%%** of pollution in A3 point (station entrance)

## Adour-Garonne

The data analysed on [Adour-Garonne webpage](05_adour_garonne.html){target="_blank"} (in *Etat des lieux* -\> *A1, A2 and A5*) results in \~**7%** rate for direct discharge pollution as a share of pollution entering WWTP.

## Rhône-Méditerranée

We do not have data for Rhône-Méditerranée. We use the same rate as Adour-Garonne, the other French Southern basin (with the closest climate), \~**7%**

# Synthesis

Caution, theses should be seen as orders of magnitude. The definition of losses may differ between basins (sometimes the A5 point is considered and sometimes not, sometimes unmonitored sewer losses are estimated and sometimes not...). At the *national scale*, the population-weigthed average is *10%*.

```{r}
#path of the file with our estimation for each basin
path_source <-"source_data/10_discharge_without_treatment/"

#load file
discharge <- 
  read.csv(
    paste0(path_source, "discharge_without_treatment_estimations.csv"),
    ) %>%
  mutate(value = paste(percent_loss*100, "%"))
#order by increasing %
discharge$basin <- reorder(discharge$basin, discharge$percent_loss)

#graph
ggplot(discharge) +
  geom_col(
    aes(
      basin, 
      percent_loss*100, 
      fill=basin
      )
    ) +
