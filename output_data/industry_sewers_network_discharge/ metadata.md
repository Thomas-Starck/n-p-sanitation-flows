The files in this folder report industries discharge to sewers networks. GÃ©orisque database is publicly available, but less complete than GEREP database. GEREP is more complete, but anonymized (industry names and IDs are not reported). We report both databases. All files report pollution for each year for the following nutrients: NGL, Pt, DBO5, DCO, MES.
  
  
GEORISQUES DATABASE
  
**industry_sewers_network_discharge_georisque_ALL.csv** reports individual industrial facilities discharges to sewers networks, with their name and ID. Pollutant flows are in **kg/year**. 
    
**industry_sewers_network_discharge_georisque_national.csv** reports industrial facilities discharges to sewers networks at the national scale. Pollutant flows are in **kt/year**. We also report the number of industrial facilities for each nutrient.
    
    
GEREP DATABASE
  
We report both nutrient _in and _out. _in refers to what enters the sewers after industry discharge. _out refers to release downstream, after wastewater treatment plant, based on actual measure or estimation of wastewater treatment plant removal efficiency. We report it as an indication but do not use it. 
  
**industry_sewers_network_discharge_GEREP_ALL.csv** reports individual industrial facilities discharges to sewers networks, with their city (COM), department (DEP) and region (REG) names (name_) and INSEE code (INSEE_). There is also an industry facility dummy ID (the data is anonymized). Pollutant flows are in **kg/year**.
    
**industry_sewers_network_discharge_GEREP_basins.csv** reports industrial facilities discharges to sewers networks at the national scale and for each water agency basin. Pollutant flows are in **kt/year**. We also report the number of industrial facilities for each nutrient.
